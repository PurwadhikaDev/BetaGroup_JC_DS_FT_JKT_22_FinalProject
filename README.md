## Overview
This repository contains a notebook focusing on Data analysis on E-Commerce Churn dataset ([Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction))
and the construction of Churn Predictive Model. With the increasing competition in the e-commerce sector, understanding and 
predicting customer churn are vital for business sustainability and growth. The notebook is written in Bahasa Indonesia and part of the Purwadhika Technology 
School Final Project. The notebook comprises the following sections:

1. Domain & Data Understanding
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
    - Data Cleaning
    - Analysis, Insights
    - EDA Conclusion and Recommendation
3. Churn Predictive Model (Machine Learning)
    - Data Preperation
    - Model Benchmarking
    - Hyperparameter Tuning
    - Final Model Performance Analysis
    - ML Conclusion & Recomendation

We also made a User Interface for some users to do a quick,easy and practical prediction by inputing the code manually. You can try to use this interface locally on your PC.

**Running the interface :**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   `cd path/to/your-repository`
  
4. Run the Streamlit application by executing the following command:
   
   `streamlit run interface_finpro.py`
